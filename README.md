# TIC TAC TOE

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game.

## THE WAY THIS WORKS
The game starts with two players, player X and player O.

player X starts. The players take turns until there is a winner or a draw.

### A DRAW
If there is a draw, the reset button appears.

### A WINNER
If there is a winner, a javascript confetti script loads (yahhhhh) and a modal pops up to announce the winner. Click on the 'x' and the modal announcement disappears.

At that point the 'reset' button appears.

Click on the 'reset' and you are ready to go again.

 The winning scores for each player is kept until you refresh your browser.

 ## TECHNOLOGIES USED
 A combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files were used.

 For CSS, normalizes and reset css files were used to clean up any browser default formatting.

 A jQuery file (jquery-1.7.2.js) is used to access jQuery DOM selectors.

 The modal css and javascript files have been kept in separate files to make it easy to include or exclude without risk of damaging other code.

 The JavaScript confetti code is kindly provided by github account [mathusummut.]( https://github.com/mathusummut/confetti.js)
